# Evaluate the following numerical expressions in your head, then use the Python interpreter to check your results:
# (a) >>> 5% 2
# (b) >>> 9 % 5
# (c) >>> 15 % 12
# (d) >>> 12 % 15
# (e) >>> 6 % 6
# (f) >>> 0 % 7
# (g) >>> 7 % 0
# What happened with the last example? Why? If you were able to correctly anticipate the computer's response in all but the last one, it is time to move on
# if not, take time now to make up examples of your own. Explore the modulus operator until you are confident you understand how it works
