# Ws ch7_6
# For what n<= 1000 is the collatz sequence the longest?  What is the sum of that sequence?  
# What is the corresponding n for this sequence? Use the function from the previous ws as a 
# helper function.  You might want some other helper functions.  This problem is somewhat easier 
# with indices or dictionaries.
