# Write a function, trngl_perim(x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3), which takes the coordinates of the 3 vertices of a triangle as 
# parameters and which returns the perimeter of the triangle. Write a helper function, distance(x1,y1,x2,y2), which 
# returns the distance between 2 points, which will be in the definition of trngl_perim(x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3).  
# Check that both functions are working correctly.

# Find the perimeter of the triangle whose vertices are
# (1,2),(3,4),(5,6).
