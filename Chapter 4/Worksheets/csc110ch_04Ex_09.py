# The number, e, Euler’s number, is an irrational number which has the value of 2.718281828459045 
# to that many decimals places. It is just as important as the number pi. [You can access the value of e from the math module as math.e.]
# A formula for ex is the infinite sum
# ex = 1 + x + x2/2! + x3/3! + …. + xn/n! + ….
# Write a function, e_to_the_x_series(x,n), which returns n terms of the above series:
# 1 + x + x2/2! + x3/3! + …. + xn/n!

# Use factorial(n) as a helper function in the definition of e_to_the_x_series(x,n).

# Print out a table of e^x for x from 0 to 5 in steps of .5.  Use n = 10.  The table should have 3 
# columns (don’t worry too much for now about making things line up):
