# XC  2 â€“ Plot a Function

# Due Date = 5/14/2020, by midnight

# Directions:
#     A. Write python code as described below. You MUST use helper functions.
#     B. Make an on screen video explaining your code & showing sample runs.
#     C. Post your video on youtube as "unlisted".  Make sure I can view it -
#     if it is private, I won't be able to view the video.
#     D. Put the link for your youtube video as a comment at the top of  your python code.
#     E.  Email to me with the email subject  x_1 your_first_name your _last_name.
#     F. A full grade on the assignment will earn you an extra 0.75 % on your final grade.

# Write python code to make an x- and y-axis and a background grid
# with the following specs:
# (1) Axes are both 600 long & centered on (0,0)
# (2) Axes are black & are made with a penwidth of 5
# (3) Background grid has a spacing of 25, is lightblue and is made with
# a penwidth of 3. No background grid lines should be made on either axis.
# See the picture below for the final output.
# (4) After drawing the grid & axes, plot f(x) = (1/6)x^2 - (1/12)x - 7.5, from
# -10 <= x <= 10 in steps of 1/4. Assume
# each unit of x corresponds to the grid spacing of 25. Put green crosses at all the
# integer points in the interval, i.e., -10,-9,-8,...,8,9,10.
# (5) You are required to use helper functions to do this assignment.
# This will help you in writing & debugging your code and in writing
# simple, transparent code.
