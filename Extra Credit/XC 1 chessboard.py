# CSC  110 Spring 2020 Extra Credit # 1 
# Due Thursday 5/14/2020 before midnight
# Worth 1.00 % of your total grade. 
# Email submission of python code which must have a link to a video explaining each function and containing  sample runs  of your code being drawn.

# Use the turtle module to write a python code to draw a chessboard.  Sample output:

# chessboard(tess,50,'blue','red’,8)  produces:

# Look up how fill a square with color using begin_fill() and end_fill().  You can switch the colors by using:
# Color1 , color2 = color2,color1.
# You MUST use helper functions in your code.  Please choose your own fill colors. Your top level function should have  the following header:

# def chessboard(t,size,c1,c2,n):
#         '''turtle t draws an n x n chessboard.  Each square is of size size and colors alternate from c1 to c2.‘’’

# Your chessboard must be scalable, so that using a larger value of size makes the chessboard uniformly larger.  
# Can you implement switching colors inside the square?
