# Print out a table for the escape velocity from the earth,  where M = 5.97 x 1024 kg is the mass of the earth,
# for r varying from 6.5 x 106 m to 15x106 m in increments of 0.5 x 106 m .  Use the formula below and print
# formatting with 3 significant figures for r and 3 significant figures for the escape velocity. Re = 6.37 x 106 m is the radius of the earth.
