# Encapsulate
# 1 fruit = "banana"
# 2 count = 0
# 3 for char in fruit:
# 4 if char == "a":
# 5 count += 1
# 6 print(count)
# in a function named count_letters, and generalize it so that it accepts the string and
# the letter as arguments. Make the function return the number of characters, rather than
# print the answer. The caller should do the printing.
