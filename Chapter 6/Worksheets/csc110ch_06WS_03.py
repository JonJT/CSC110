# Write a function, quadratic(a,b,c), which returns the solutions for a quadratic equation,
# ax^2 + bx + c = 0.  Use conditionals as appropriate. Use your function to print out the  solutions for several different  quadratic equations:
# a,b,c = 1,-1,-2
# a,b,c = 1,10,25
# a,b,c = 1,-2.5,-6.25
# a,b,c = 6,1,12
