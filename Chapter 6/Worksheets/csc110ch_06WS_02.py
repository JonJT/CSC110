# The area of a triangle can be found from the formula
# A = sqrt(s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c)),
# Where
#  a,b,c are the length of the 3 sides of the triangle, and
# s = (perimeter)/2
# Write a function, triangle_area(x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3),
# Which returns the area of a triangle whose vertices have the coordinates (x1,y1),(x2,y2),(x3,y3).  Use appropriate helper functions. Check the correctness
# Of your code.
