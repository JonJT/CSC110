# The four compass points can be abbreviated by single-letter strings as “N”, “E”, “S”, and
# “W”. Write a function turn_clockwise that takes one of these four compass points
# as its parameter, and returns the next compass point in the clockwise direction. Here are
# some tests that should pass:
# test(turn_clockwise("N") == "E")
# test(turn_clockwise("W") == "N")
# You might ask “What if the argument to the function is some other value?” For all other
# cases, the function should return the value None:
# test(turn_clockwise(42) == None)
# test(turn_clockwise("rubbish") == None)

def turn_clockwise(x):
    if x == "N":
        return "E"
    elif x == "E":
        return "S"
    elif x == "S":
        return "W"
    elif x == "W":
        return "N"
    else:
        return "None"

print(turn_clockwise("N") == "E")
